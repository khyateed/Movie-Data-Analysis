# Phase 1 Final Project - Campus Graded

## Introduction

In this lesson, we review the guidelines for the Phase 1 Final Project.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Start your Phase 1 Final Project
* Check that your project meets the requirements
* Submit your project materials in Canvas
* Prepare for your presentation and project review

## Project Overview

You've made it all the way through the first phase of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

All that remains in Phase 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project! This project will take an entire week to complete. 

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

**Level Up**: Scrape websites or make API calls to get additional data.

If you struggled with the Code Challenge, use only the following data files:

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

## The Deliverables

There are four deliverables for this project:

1. A **GitHub repository**
2. A **Jupyter Notebook**
3. A **Non-technical presentation**
4. A **Blog post**

Refer to the rubric associated with this assignment for detailed information about the deliverable requirements.

### GitHub Repository

TBD

### Jupyter Notebook

For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:

### Non-Technical Presentation

Your target audience is non-technical people interested in using your findings to make decisions for creating movies. 
We recommend using Google Slides, PowerPoint or Keynote to create your presentation.
Your presentation must be saved as a `presentation.pdf` file in your repository.  

### Blog Post Must-Haves

Refer to the [Blogging Guidelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging-v2-1) for blog requirements and ideas.

## The Process

### Getting Started

### Submitting your Project

**NEEDS OVERHAUL**

You’re almost done! In order to submit your project for review, include the following links to your work in the corresponding fields on the right-hand side of Learn.

1. **GitHub Repo:** Now that you’ve completed your project in Jupyter Notebooks, push your work to GitHub and paste that link to the right. (If you need help doing so, review the resources [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CNGDhjcQZDRx2sWByd2v-mgUOjy13Cd_hQYVXPuzEDE/edit#gid=0).)
_Reminder: Make sure to also add and commit a pdf of your non-technical presentation to the repository with a file name of presentation.pdf._
2. **Blog Post:** Include a link to your blog post.
3. **Record Walkthrough:** Include a link to your video walkthrough.

Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up. You will receive an email in order to schedule your review with your instructor.

## Project Review

You have until the end of the week to present your project and submit your project. Project submissions are due at the end of project week, and will be reviewed by teachers on the Monday or Tuesday of the following week.

Teachers will use the rubric in Canvas associated with this assignment to grade your submission and presentation. You can earn 0, 1, or 2 points on each element. You will receive a final 1-5 score based on the percentage of available points you earn. A score of 3 or higher is considered passing.

*  0% to 29% = 1
* 30% to 49% = 2
* 50% to 69% = 3
* 70% to 89% = 4
* 90% to 100% = 5

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!

## Tips

Ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often if you need it.
